# Applied-Bayesian-Statistical-Analysis

The public space issue arose due to the low-usage rate of two study rooms. The authority planned to realloocate and reduce the number of seats provided. Therefore, this motivates us to investigate the study room usuage and to provide statistical inference to the authority.  Our study aims to know 
1. number of students using each of study room
2. mean difference number between two study rooms

Data were collected from the card beepers of study rooms, recording time points and student IDs from Sep 9 to Dec 15 in 2018. We focus only on the usage during the semester and exclud the major festivals with extreme low numbers of students.
